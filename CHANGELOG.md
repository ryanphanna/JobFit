# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-02-02

### Changed
- **UI**: Removed "Role Model Synthesis" card from logged-out marketing grid. Kept 8 cards for a perfect 2x4 layout: JobFit Score, Keyword Targeting, Private Vault, Smart Cover Letters, Tailored Summaries, Bookmarklet, AI Career Coach, and 12-Month Roadmap.
- **UI**: Updated `WelcomeScreen` feature cards to use `rounded-[2.5rem]` border radius for consistency with the glassmorphism design system.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **UI**: Removed the "Bookmarklet" card from the marketing grid to create a perfect 8-card layout (2 rows of 4).

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **UI**: Aligned logged-out marketing card dimensions with logged-in action cards. Updated to 4-column grid, `p-6` padding, and `1920px` max-width.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **UI**: Fixed a bug where both marketing cards and action cards would render simultaneously for logged-out users. Added strict user session checks to the action card grid.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
