# How to Chat with AI in VS Code (Simple Guide)

## Quick Start - 3 Steps

### 1. Install GitHub Copilot Chat
- Open VS Code
- Click Extensions (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
- Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat"
- Click Install
- Sign in with your GitHub account

### 2. Open the Chat
- Click the chat icon in the left sidebar 💬
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac)

### 3. Start Chatting!
Just ask questions like:
- "What does this JobFit app do?"
- "How can I add a new feature?"
- "Explain how the resume blocks work"
- "What improvements can I make to this app?"

**That's it!** The AI can now see your whole project and give you specific answers.

## Why It Works Now

I added a special file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) that tells the AI about:
- What JobFit is and how it works
- The technology you're using (React, TypeScript, Supabase, etc.)
- How the code is organized
- Your app's features (resume blocks, job analysis, cover letters, etc.)

So instead of generic answers, the AI gives you **JobFit-specific** help.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to pay for Copilot?**  
A: Yes, GitHub Copilot costs $10/month (or free for students/teachers)

**Q: What if I don't want to pay?**  
A: Try these free alternatives:
- **Cursor IDE** - Free VS Code alternative with AI built-in
- **Codeium** - Free AI assistant extension
- **Continue.dev** - Free extension for VS Code

**Q: The AI still gives generic answers. Why?**  
A: Make sure you:
1. Opened VS Code in the `/JobFit` folder (not a parent folder)
2. Reloaded the window after installing extensions
3. Are asking about specific files or features

## Quick Examples

**Ask about features:**
> "What are all the features in this JobFit app?"

**Get improvement ideas:**
> "What features could we add to make this app better?"

**Understand code:**
> "How does the job analysis scoring work?"

**Add new stuff:**
> "Help me add a feature to export resumes as PDF"

**Debug issues:**
> "This component isn't re-rendering when state changes, why?"
